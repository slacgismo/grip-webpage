### Status: Completed 
**Summary**

GRIP deployed a simplified version of PG&E’s distribution system using QGIS. The main layer is
a modified version of PG&E’s Integration Capacity Analysis(ICA) shapefiles, parsed down to
include 2764 kilometers of power lines consisting of 31 distribution feeders drawing power from 8
substations within Napa County. Lines extending from these substations beyond the county line
were included, and lines from substations outside of Napa County were excluded. Additionally,
feeders were assumed to be independent from one another. After simplifications were made to the
distribution system, the result was a set of 31 independent feeders with power flowing one way from
substation to end nodes. These feeders were divided into 102 subfeeders using 84 current and planned
sectionalizing devices. The locations of these subfeeders were approximated using PG&E online map
interface (see image below), and manually digitized onto the modified ICA map. By segmenting subfeeders, this
allows for the partial shutdown of feeders in only affected areas, instead of PG&E shutting down the
entire feeder. Subfeeder customer counts were estimated from ICA data and geospacially weighted
by population within 500 meters of line vectors. The resulting topology was sampled into about
92,000 points at 30-meter increments, which are used as the input values for the optimization model.
