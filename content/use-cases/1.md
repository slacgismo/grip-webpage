GRIP's anticipation module is designed to aid in electrical grid planning and operation when facing extreme weather related grid events. The tool assigns a vulnerability metric to each asset based on a number of available data sets such as weather forecast, equipment characteristics, distribution network model, and vegetation data.

Use-cases developed under the anticipation module are as follows: 

[1. Pole Vulnerability](#Pole-Vulnerability)

[1.1 Bulk Pole Vulnerability](#Bulk-Pole-Vulnerability)

[1.2 Pole Vulnerability with Network Model](#Pole-Vulnerability-with-Network-Model)

[2. Conductor Vulnerability](#Conductor-Vulnerability)

[3. Resilience Metric](#Resilience-Metric)

[4. Optimal Grid Operation under Extreme Events](#Optimal-Grid-Operation-under-Extreme-Events)





### Pole Vulnerability
#### 1.1 Bulk Pole Vulnerability 
#### 1.2 Pole Vulnerability with Network Model

### 2. Conductor Vulnerability
### 3. Optimal Grid Operation under Extreme Events
