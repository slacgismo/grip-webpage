   <p> Given the wide range of risks posed by anthropomorphic climate change, associated extreme weather events, and the vulnerability of power infrastructure to attack, there is an acute need to design energy infrastructure systems to be increasingly resilient to both natural events and intentional attacks. This report summarizes results from research and development work focused on making power distribution systems more resilient to extreme disturbances, such as ice storms and forest fires. The work described in this report was led by Packetized Energy and is one component of a research and development initiative led by the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory known as GRIP: The Grid Resilience and Intelligence Platform.
      The specific aim of this report is to describe the “Absorption” element of the GRIP platform. The overall goal of Absorption is to enable distribution networks to gracefully “absorb" disturbances through automatic reconfiguration of feeders into microgrids, each of which operates with local resources to serve as much load as possible. To do so, we use two key technological innovations. First, Virtual Islanding technology enables a distribution circuit to be automatically reconfigured into self-managing microgrids. Second, we adapted Packetized Energy Management to the specific problem of using distributed energy resources within the automatically formed islands to maintain the balance between supply and demand, while serving as much load as possible.
      The results clearly show that Virtual Islanding has the potential to dramatically increase resilience in distribution circuits. In one illustrative ‘fire’ case, the use of absorption reduced the unserved energy from a one-day outage from nearly 100% to only 20%.

   <p> There is increasing consensus that flexible demand is critical to solve challenges associated with the rapid growth of variable renewable generation and aging transmission, distri-
      bution and generation infrastructure. Conventional direct load control programs are largely insufficient to address these issues.
      This paper presents results from validation tests of a new approach to demand side management, in which an aggregated
      fleet of devices is managed as a virtual battery, using principles that are found in communication networks: packetization and
      randomization. Validation results from a cyber-physical testbed with 5000 devices and a field-trial with 82 customer-owned
      water heaters show that the packetized virtual battery system can effectively solve a number of different problems. Customer
      satisfaction survey results illustrate that the system is able to maintain a high level of service quality.

The pole failure model in GridLAB-D is designed to examine multiple failure modes. However, given that ground-level structural failures are reported as the most frequent, the current implementation only supports these. Other failure modes may be provided in future versions of GridLAB-D.

      <h3> "Recovery Final Report" </h3>
   </a>
   <p> Stanford National Accelerator Laboratory,LBNL, "GRIP Phase 3 Rcovery Final Report," A report that explains the Recovery Phase of the Grid Resiliency and Intelligence Project (GRIP).,p.8. [Online]. Available: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/12Vtj5m_ySWongeI7Rj6lE7cmHqb_0mst/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">https://drive.google.com/file/d/12Vtj5m_ySWongeI7Rj6lE7cmHqb_0mst/view?usp=sharing</a></p>
   The goal Recovery Phase of the Grid Resiliency and Intelligence Project (GRIP) is to leverage distributed energy resources (DER) to facilitate faster and safer electricity distribution network reconfiguration and recovery after a catastrophic network event. Grid recovery will be achieved through grid reconfiguration, islanding, and reconnecting islanded portions. Reconfiguration will necessitate switching actions (i.e. opening and closing of distribution network switches). To prevent large power surges, arcing, and equipment damage during switching actions, DER will be employed to minimize the voltage difference across the ends of a switch. This additionally reduces the need to deploy mobile utility crews. DER will be managed by a model-free online optimization algorithm, known as extremum seeking (ES). The GRIP platform has functionality to simulate the Recovery scenario, with GridLab-D as the underlying power flow solver.

      <h3> "Model-Free Optimal Voltage Phasor Regulation in Unbalanced Distribution Systems"</h3>
   </a>
   <p> M. D. Sankur , R. Dobbe , A. von Meier , Member, IEEE, and D. B. Arnold, "Model-Free Optimal Voltage Phasor Regulation in Unbalanced Distribution Systems" IEEE Transactions on SMART GRID.,VOL.11, NO. 1,p.11, JANUARY 2020 [Online]. Available: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jHZxqsKxJBEMGOLAqmsfekUJ54m7cEHy/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jHZxqsKxJBEMGOLAqmsfekUJ54m7cEHy/view?usp=sharing</a></p>
   The proliferation of voltage Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) into electric power distribution grids presents new opportunities for utility operators to manage their systems more effectively. In particular, distribution-level PMUs can serve as proxy measurements for active and reactive power flows, thus alleviating the need for current transformer-based measurements for certain applications. In this work, we explore the use of distri-
   bution PMU measurements to optimally control line power flows without explicit measurements of these quantities and without a priori knowledge of the underlying distribution system topology. To do so, we extend a 2 dimensional Extremum Seeking (2D-ES) control paradigm to simultaneously manage Distributed Energy Resource (DER) active and reactive power contributions in unbalanced distribution systems. Simulation results show the ability of the proposed approach to virtually island different portions of a 3-phase unbalanced the network using DER injections while maintaining proper voltage magnitudes in the rest of the network.
