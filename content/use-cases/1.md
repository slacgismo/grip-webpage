title: "Use Case #1 (Anticipation)"

 The anticipation use-case can help in planning and operation of the electrical grid during major grid events. The tool assigns an asset vulnerability metric Using weather data as an input that defines maintenance requirements for that particular asset. The pole failure model in GridLAB-D has been updated to support the extended Grid Resilience Intelligence Platform (GRIP) use case for the *HiPAS Project (CEC EPC-17-046)*. Utility structures must be designed to support conductors, equipment, hardware, and the cables of other companies (telephone and cable TV (CATV.)) Moreover, the structures must be capable of handling the force of the wind blowing against the structure and all the equipment and conductors attached to the  structure.  


### Ground-level Failure

A pole can fail at or near the ground line due to excessive forces on the structure. The following forces are considered:

1. Wire weight loading due to pole tilt angle
2. Wire loading due to wind pressure on wire
3. Loading due to wire tension asymmetry
4. Wire ice loading
5. Wire sag loading due to sag asymmetry
6. Wire loading due to line sway
7. Wire loading due to line gallop




**Anticipate-Microgrid Design Tool**

 *Goal:*

 Due to  the ability of a load to shape over a 1yr time period
determine what combination of solar, wind, and  
batteries increases resiliency and minimizes cost.

 **Methods:**

  NREL provides an API that can be used  
to optimize for economics and resiliency.

- Our design allows for single-site or multi-site  
microgrid design. Multi-site analysis provides  
results both if:

 *1. each site is treated as a separate microgrid*

*2. a single microgrid were to support all sites*

- Results include recommended technology size,  
detailed financial analysis (proforma), time-series  
plots for solar and wind generation, solar, wind,
and battery consumption (Basic power  
outage survivability information is also provided).

- Allows load operator (a utility or a building owner)  
to determine the requirements for and benefits of,  
establishing a microgrid for their specific loads
