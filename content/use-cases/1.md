title: "Use Case #1 (Anticipation)"

 The anticipation use-case can help in planning and operation of the electrical grid during major grid events. The tool assigns an asset vulnerability metric Using weather data as an input that defines maintenance requirements for that particular asset. The pole failure model in GridLAB-D has been updated to support the extended Grid Resilience Intelligence Platform (GRIP) use case for the *HiPAS Project (CEC EPC-17-046)*. Utility structures must be designed to support conductors, equipment, hardware, and the cables of other companies (telephone and cable TV (CATV.)) Moreover, the structures must be capable of handling the force of the wind blowing against the structure and all the equipment and conductors attached to the  structure.  


### Ground-level Failure

A pole can fail at or near the ground line due to excessive forces on the structure. The following forces are considered:

1. Wire weight loading due to pole tilt angle
2. Wire loading due to wind pressure on wire
3. Loading due to wire tension asymmetry
4. Wire ice loading
5. Wire sag loading due to sag asymmetry
6. Wire loading due to line sway
7. Wire loading due to line gallop

*Other failure modes are possible, including superstructure failures and foundation failures, however these are not considered at this time.*




**Anticipate-Microgrid Design Tool**

 *Goal:*

 Due to  the ability of a load to shape over a 1yr time period
determine what combination of solar, wind, and  
batteries increases resiliency and minimizes cost.

 **Methods:**

 The basic method of evaluating the condition of a pole relative to ground-line structural failure is to calculate the resisting moment at ground level and compare that with the total moment from the loads present.  

The resisting moment for a wood pole at the ground line is computed as:

**Table 2**: Ultimate Fiber Stress of Selected Wood Products


Pole degradation is modeled by computing the rate at which the interior is hollowed out by rot. The hollow interior diameter grows at the rate R such that the interior hollow diameter is given by DR = 2 Y R, (where Y is the age of the pole). When considering pole degradation, the resisting moment is  

![Figure 1-Hinesburg circuit plotted with edge width relative to GridLab-D](/ANT_USECASE_EQUATION.png)

*Note*: Ground line failure assumption ignores the possibility that the hollow interior diameter may lead to failure at the midpoint of the pole or at the pole top near the superstructure.


**Pole Loading Due to Pole Tilt Angle**

A tilted pole is represented below, where *H*, *D0*, and *D1* are measured in ft, and M is measured in ft.lb.

![Figure 1-Hinesburg circuit plotted with edge width relative to GridLab-D](/ANT_USECASE_POLE_LOADING.png)

For small angles , the moment resulting from the tilt of a pole of uniform diameter D and height H is

![Figure 1-Hinesburg circuit plotted with edge width relative to GridLab-D](/ANT_USECASE_EQUATION_2.png)
m is the mass of the pole in lbs. The mass m of the pole can be calculated using the density of the material, where

![Figure 1-Hinesburg circuit plotted with edge width relative to GridLab-D](/ANT_USECASE_EQUATION_3.png)

The taper of the pole must be considered, in which case the moment is
![Figure 1-Hinesburg circuit plotted with edge width relative to GridLab-D](/ANT_USECASE_EQUATION_4.png)
where m(h) dh is the mass at the height h, such that
![Figure 1-Hinesburg circuit plotted with edge width relative to GridLab-D](/ANT_USECASE_EQUATION_5.png)
with r(h)=0.5 [D0-(D0-D1) h/H] measured in ft. The resulting moment is
![Figure 1-Hinesburg circuit plotted with edge width relative to GridLab-D](/ANT_USECASE_EQUATION_6.png)

**Mounted equipment loading due to pole tilt**

Equipment mounted on a tilted pole may induce small changes in the moment depending on the position relative to the pole's centerline and the tilt direction.  The moment of equipment mounted offset from the pole's centerline is:
![Figure 1-Hinesburg circuit plotted with edge width relative to GridLab-D](/ANT_USECASE_EQUATION_7.png)
where W is the weight of the equipment in lbs and X is the offset distance in ft.  When the pole is tilted at an angle  and the equipment is mounted direction =E-T relative to the pole tilt direction, then the moment is
![Figure 1-Hinesburg circuit plotted with edge width relative to GridLab-D](/ANT_USECASE_EQUATION_8.png)

**Wire weight loading due to pole tilt angle**

The moment due to cable loading is computed as:
![Figure 1-Hinesburg circuit plotted with edge width relative to GridLab-D](/ANT_WIRE_EQUATION_EXPLANATION.png)

With the presence of pole tilt, the tension in the wires can significantly increase the load on the pole. To calculate the moment on the pole due to the angle of the conductors, the follow formula can be used:
![Figure 1-Hinesburg circuit plotted with edge width relative to GridLab-D](/ANT_WIRE_EQUATION_2.png)
where ![Figure 1-Hinesburg circuit plotted with edge width relative to GridLab-D](/ANT_WIRE_EQUATION_3.png)
is the breaking strength.
 ![Figure 1-Hinesburg circuit plotted with edge width relative to GridLab-D](/ANT_SUBSCRIPT.png) multiplied by the percent design tension ![Figure 1-Hinesburg circuit plotted with edge width relative to GridLab-D](/ANT_SUBSCRIPT_1.png)in lbs, ![Figure 1-Hinesburg circuit plotted with edge width relative to GridLab-D](/ANT_SUBSCRIPT_2.png) is the overload capacity factor as given in *Table 3*, Î¸ is the angle of the pole in degrees, and H is the height of the conductor attachment in ft.

 **Wind Pressure on Pole**

 Wind pressure is the main source of moments on poles. The formula for calculating the moments due to wind is:
 ![Figure 1-Hinesburg circuit plotted with edge width relative to GridLab-D](/ANT_WIND_PRESSURE_EQUATION.png)
 where W is the wind pressure in lb/sf.

 The wind pressure is calculated as:
 ![Figure 1-Hinesburg circuit plotted with edge width relative to GridLab-D](/ANT_WIND_PRESSURE_EQUATION_1.png)
 V is the wind speed in mph

 **Wind loading due to wind pressure on mounted equipment**

 Voltage regulators, capacitor banks, and transformers can induce large wind moments on poles.  The formula for calculating the moment is:
 ![Figure 1-Hinesburg circuit plotted with edge width relative to GridLab-D](/WIND_PRESSURE_EQUIPMENT.png)
 where A is the cross-sectional area of the equipment in sf, and ![Figure 1-Hinesburg circuit plotted with edge width relative to GridLab-D](/VARIABLE_SUBSCRIPT.png) is the height at which the equipment is mounted on the pole.
 *Note: the moment only captures the direct force*

 **Wire loading due to wind pressure on wire**

 Wind pressure on conductors constitutes a significant part of the load on pole structures. The formula for calculating the wire loading due to wind pressure is:
 ![Figure 1-Hinesburg circuit plotted with edge width relative to GridLab-D](/POLE_STRUCTURE_EQUATION.png)
 ![Figure 1-Hinesburg circuit plotted with edge width relative to GridLab-D](/POLE_STRUCTURE_EXPLANATION.png)

When there is ice on the conductors, the wire loading (due to wind pressure) will significantly increase. However, without ice, this formula is still used to calculate the intermediate value for wire loading due to wind pressure on wire where:
