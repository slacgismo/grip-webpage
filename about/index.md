# Combating Cilmate Change with Electrical Grid Resilience

GRIP (Grid Resilience and Intelligence Platform) is a cutting-edge software platform designed to help electric grid operators anticipate, mitigate against, and recover from the effects of extreme weather events. By combining state-of-the-art agent-based grid modeling tools with grid resilience metrics, GRIP can quantify the state of the grid assets before extreme events, and provide grid operators with actionable insights, such as staging maintenance crew locations, proactive pole hardening or grid topology reconfiguration, to help minimize equipment damage and revenue loss due to power outages. 

## Background

GRIP is a project led by the Department of Energyâ€™s SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory that combines artificial intelligence with massive amounts of data and industry experience from a dozen U.S. partners to identify places where the electric grid is vulnerable to disruption, reinforce those spots in advance and recover faster when failures do occur. The project has been deployed with one of the largest California investor-owned utilities (IOUs), Southern California Edison (SCE).

The goal of GRIP is to assist distribution utilities in responding to grid events by:

- Anticipating grid events using machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques with diverse data sources.
- Absorbing grid events by employing validated control strategies for distributed energy resources; and
- Reducing recovery time by managing distributed energy resources in the case of limited communications.

With GRIP, electrical utility operators can reduce operating costs by optimizing grid hardening costs and lowering liability costs and shareholder exposure. These grid operator benefits will ultimately lead to lower electricity rates for customers.

## Customer Need

Increasingly frequent severe weather events cost grid operators billions of dollars per year in repair cost. In 2022, $12.4 billion in weather related utility debt was issued in the U.S., which has led to dramatic increase in prices of electricity across several states. In the state of Louisiana alone, severe storms caused an estimated $4.4 billion in grid damage in 2020 and 2021. In response to this growing risk, grid operators are spending billions of dollars annually to harden their infrastructure against harm. 

Without effective tools to guide these investments, their effectiveness is limited.  Utilities are plagued by department data silos, leaving them ill-equipped to focus their grid hardening investments where it will do the most good. In addition, these silos result in an inability to quantify the indirect costs associated with large scale weather events, such as accident liability costs. Without an accurate view into these costs, grid operators struggle to justify long term investments disassociated from short-term rate design cycle. 

## Benefits
GRIP can unlock several benefits, including:

**Improved Resilience:** GRIP can help to improve the resilience of the energy grid by providing early warning of potential disruptions and enabling a rapid response to these disruptions. Given limited resources, GRIP aids in determining the grid asset hardening prioritization given grid topology, local generation, types of consumers and other relevant data. This can help reduce the impact of disruptions and minimize downtime, in turn reducing liability costs due to negligence, and reduce grid hardening costs.

**Revenue Impact:** GRIP can evaluate the reliability and resilience performance of the electrical grid. GRIP can provide real-time monitoring of grid performance, predictive maintenance, and the ability to quickly respond to disruptions. This can help to reduce downtime and improve the overall efficiency of the energy system, helping to attract new customers and increase revenue by unlocking new revenue streams. 

**Equity and diversity:** GRIP is designed to quantify the impact of devastating events on the entire electricity distribution system. By considering the census data, system topology redundancy, local generation and resiliency-enabling technology availability, GRIP can aid utility operators to correctly allocate limited energy resources while best supporting  disadvantaged communities.
