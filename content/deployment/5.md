### Status: Ongoing

SCE has a number of priorities that can be addressed through GRIP as outlined here. The platform can address and quantify the potential loss of property due to fire damage, injury and fatality. GRIP can aid SCE with mitigation of in the events that lack communication, decision making authority, or cause interruptions / loss of network hardware, computing infrastructure, cybersecurity, physical security and service interruption. Using the GRIP metrics, prioritization of network assets can be achieved that incentivise upkeep of critical customers, critical infrastructure, high fire risk areas and underprivileged communities.
