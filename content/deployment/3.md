### Description of the process/scenario:

*The information below explains the deployment process for the Absorption project in further detail.*

                    |Deployment Process of Extremum Seeking and Validation|

  The ES approach assumes that the inputs and outputs are known to the system but does not know what happens in-between. The basic operation is as follows:

1.Start with a setpoint in each controller

2.ES controllers start probing the system

3.ES controllers take measurements of the system (voltage magnitude and voltage angle)

4.Perform filtering: high-pass filtering of the objective function, demodulate with the same probe signals. Apply a low pass filter

5.Compute an objective function. After filtering of the objective function and demodulation, we obtain a gradient estimate of the objective function with respect to the inputs (DER active and reactive power).

6.Feed/integrate this objective function back to the ES controllers through inverters

7.Continue this process until we achieve convergence. Multiple ES controllers simultaneously optimize a global objective function (scalar value).
