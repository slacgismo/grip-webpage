draft: false
---
Due to loss of network and communication capability from a Cyber
attack or earthquake, be able to access status of network (powerflows, voltage, etc) and
use DERs to control distribution system stability and power quality to improve operations
practices, and system hardening.

=======
Extremum Seeking (ES) is a model-free optimization and control approach that can be utilized online or offline. ES approximates gradient descent (in single and multiple dimensions). Through disturbance of system input (output of the ES), the ES algorithm estimates the gradient of an unknown objective function with respect to its control setpoint(s). The Extremum Seeking approach has been tested in hardware in the loop experiments and in live field tests.

*Figure 1* below shows a block diagram of the overall ES architecture for multiple 2D-ES controllers managing active and reactive power contributions of distributed energy resources (DERs). In this use case, the objective represents a distribution network, measurements of pertinent system states, and computation of a value that the 2D-ES controllers operate to minimize. A single 2D-ES controller is encircled by the red box, with its active power channel is encircled by the green box, and its reactive power channel is encircled by the blue box. In the figure below, LPF stands for lowpass filter, HPF stands for high pass filter, and INT denotes the integrator
