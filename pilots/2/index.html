Main switches for absorption / virtual islanding algorithm are denoted by large squares (red are initially closed, green are initially open). Figure 2 represents the same network with node colors which indicate the node voltages.This circuit model modeled voltages and edge width and color relative to GridLab-D modeled line currents (larger red nodes are switches and their size is not relative to the voltages at those locations).\nStep 2: Build a reduced format model that could be imported into GRIP. This reduced model (represented below as figure 3 and figure 4) is developed by dividing the circuit into sections that were separated by switching elements, and then defining each group as a “super-node” in the reduced model. Figure 4 represents the possible island groups as “super-nodes”, where “super-nodes” are connected by switches, where the substation is located at “supernode_001\". (Super-node sizes are scaled based on number of houses connected).\nFigure 3: Hinesburg circuit plotted with potential islands represented in different colors. Figure 4: Reduced model of Hinesburg circuit with possible islands grouped into “super-nodes\" Step 3: Develop a ‘large ice’ scenario for this full system-3 faulted nodes, and simulate this large ice scenario with the GRIP code. Without Absorption, this set of three faults would have left the entire circuit without power for 1 full day (the assumed time to repair).\nNote: The following deployment steps were conducted and represents 100% of unserved energy. However, when Absorption is in place, unserved energy was reduced to 10% (see figure below).\nFigure 5: Timeseries output from GridLab-D for the reduced Hinesburg circuit with three super-nodes faulted and GRIP absorption algorithms ","wordCount":"776","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-31T17:12:57-08:00","dateModified":"2022-12-31T17:12:57-08:00","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://grip.energy/pilots/2/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"GRIP","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http://drive.google.com/uc?export=view\u0026id=1AAQQvjCWqY0XMdCdFCPPAAqrwNMw_-Jm"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><noscript><style type=text/css>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style></noscript><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://grip.energy/ accesskey=h><img src="http://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1SVJeXkmu6WrvxfVzslkZ84iMTETbx9JX" alt=logo aria-label=logo height=30px></a>
