Given the wide range of risks posed by anthropomorphic climate change, associated extreme weather events, and the vulnerability of power infrastructure to attack, there is an acute need to design energy infrastructure systems to be increasingly resilient to both natural events and intentional attacks. This report summarizes results from research and development work focused on making power distribution systems more resilient to extreme disturbances, such as ice storms and forest fires. The work described in this report was led by Packetized Energy and is one component of a research and development initiative led by the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory known as GRIP: The Grid Resilience and Intelligence Platform.
The specific aim of this report is to describe the “Absorption” element of the GRIP platform. The overall goal of Absorption is to enable distribution networks to gracefully “absorb" disturbances through automatic reconfiguration of feeders into microgrids, each of which operates with local resources to serve as much load as possible. To do so, we use two key technological innovations. First, Virtual Islanding technology enables a distribution circuit to be automatically reconfigured into self-managing microgrids. Second, we adapted Packetized Energy Management to the specific problem of using distributed energy resources within the automatically formed islands to maintain the balance between supply and demand, while serving as much load as possible.
The results clearly show that Virtual Islanding has the potential to dramatically increase resilience in distribution circuits. In one illustrative ‘fire’ case, the use of absorption reduced the unserved energy from a one-day outage from nearly 100% to only 20%.

There is increasing consensus that flexible demand is critical to solve challenges associated with the rapid growth of variable renewable generation and aging transmission, distri-
bution and generation infrastructure. Conventional direct load control programs are largely insufficient to address these issues.
This paper presents results from validation tests of a new approach to demand side management, in which an aggregated
fleet of devices is managed as a virtual battery, using principles that are found in communication networks: packetization and
randomization. Validation results from a cyber-physical testbed with 5000 devices and a field-trial with 82 customer-owned
water heaters show that the packetized virtual battery system can effectively solve a number of different problems. Customer
satisfaction survey results illustrate that the system is able to maintain a high level of service quality.
