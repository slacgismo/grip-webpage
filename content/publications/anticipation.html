<p> Stanford National Accelerator Laboratory, "HIPAS Pole Failure Model," A report that explains the pole failure model in GridLAB-D.,p.9, May 2021. [Online]. Available: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YIE-APB3BAdWODMGrh3vEq0z24C6Qg4zZsanQuo9ckg/edit#heading=h.aqds4lacg3pl </p>
The pole failure model in GridLAB-D is designed to examine multiple failure modes. However, given that ground-level structural failures are reported as the most frequent, the current implementation only supports these. Other failure modes may be provided in future versions of GridLAB-D.
