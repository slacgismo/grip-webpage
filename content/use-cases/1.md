 The anticipation use-case can help in planning and operation of the electrical grid during major grid events. The tool assigns an asset vulnerability metric Using weather data as an input that defines maintenance requirements for that particular asset. The pole failure model in GridLAB-D has been updated to support the extended Grid Resilience Intelligence Platform (GRIP) use case for the *HiPAS Project (CEC EPC-17-046)*. Utility structures must be designed to support conductors, equipment, hardware, and the cables of other companies (telephone and cable TV (CATV.)) Moreover, the structures must be capable of handling the force of the wind blowing against the structure and all the equipment and conductors attached to the  structure.  


### Ground-level Failure

A pole can fail at or near the ground line due to excessive forces on the structure. The following forces are considered:

1. Wire weight loading due to pole tilt angle
2. Wire loading due to wind pressure on wire
3. Loading due to wire tension asymmetry
4. Wire ice loading
5. Wire sag loading due to sag asymmetry
6. Wire loading due to line sway
7. Wire loading due to line gallop

*Other failure modes are possible, including superstructure failures and foundation failures, however these are not considered at this time.*
