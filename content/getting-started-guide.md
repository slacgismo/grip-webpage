# This is where the web platform will live!

*Let us walk you through the step by step process to accessing the web platform! To begin, let us start with Anticipation*

**Step 1**: First thing is first, make sure you have a username and password to access your account.

**Step 2**: Access your dashboard from the menu, and select *simulation under the Anticipation option*. You can access various simulations depending on what you choose.

**Step 3**: Access GRIP simulation analysis for risk modeling and quantification questions that pertain to vegetation. This is where the user can access information such as vulnerability levels, navigate specific node locations. The simulation analysis allows for users to see effects of vegetation on on the electrical system and the effect of the electrical system on the surrounding environment.

## Do not worry, you are almost there

**Absorption**

*We would like to show you our GRIP design...with cool features of course!*

![Figure 2-Hinesburg circuit plotted with edge width relative to GridLab-D](/AB_DEMO_2_SLIDE_1.png)

**Let us tell you about the features:**

1. Users can view previous and active Absorption simulations
2. Users get an overview of key metrics and outcomes
3. Management and link out to simulation details

**But wait, there's more**

![Figure 2-Hinesburg circuit plotted with edge width relative to GridLab-D](/AB_DEMO_2_SLIDE_2.png)

Now, with simulation setup under Absorption, we have features such as:

1. GLM model support
2. Specification of simulation Duration
3. Toggle Absorption algorithm

During the simulation, users can see a graphical representation of Network Topology.

![Figure 2-Hinesburg circuit plotted with edge width relative to GridLab-D](/AB_DEMO_2_SLIDE_3.png)

Under this simulation, users can access tools such as:

1. Pause/Restart simulation
2. Graphical representation of Network Topology
3. Categorized list of Network Assets
4. Graphical Simulation log
5. Time Series chart of Grid Metrics

In addition, users have access to the Asset editor under Absorption where they can:

1. Toggle Manual Fault
2. Live edit Solar/Battery properties
3. Overview of key Asset properties

*We are almost arriving at the Finish-line!*

**Recovery**

Under the dashboard under Recovery, users have access to features such as:

1. View previous and active Recovery simulations
2. Management and link out to simulation details

![Figure 2-Hinesburg circuit plotted with edge width relative to GridLab-D](/REC_DEMO_3_SLIDE_1.png)

Users can then proceed with Recovery setup for the recovery simulation (similar process used for Absorption).

![Figure 2-Hinesburg circuit plotted with edge width relative to GridLab-D](/REC_DEMO_3_SLIDE_2.png)

The Recovery setup features:

1. GLM model support
2. Weather model support
3. Dynamic GLM parsing

We then move to Recovery Simulation Configuration

![Figure 2-Hinesburg circuit plotted with edge width relative to GridLab-D](/REC_DEMO_3_SLIDE_3.png)

Key Features include:
1. Graphical/Map representation of Network Topology
2. Configuration of Network Controller properties
3. Selection and prioritization of Network Segments

Once the user inputs the configurations for the simulations, users will see graphical representations of their simulation results which include:

1. Objective Function output
2. Controller Power output
3. Segment Node Voltage output
4. Segment Node Voltage differences output
5. Toggle across Controller phases

![Figure 2-Hinesburg circuit plotted with edge width relative to GridLab-D](/REC_DEMO_3_SLIDE_4.png)

*We have reached the finish-line!*

Lastly, when dealing with the user interface, users can view the network topology, which feature segment optimization configuration. Users can also adjust controllers and view specific nodes.Once users load a simulation, they have access to the network topology.
