GRIP's anticipation module is designed to aid in electrical grid planning and operation when facing extreme weather related grid events. The tool assigns a vulnerability metric to each asset based on a number of available data sets such as weather forecast, equipment characteristics, distribution network model, and vegetation data.

Use-cases developed under the anticipation module are as follows: 

[1. Pole Vulnerability](#Pole-Vulnerability)

[1.1 Bulk Pole Vulnerability](#Bulk-Pole-Vulnerability)

[1.2 Pole Vulnerability with Network Model](#Pole-Vulnerability-with-Network-Model)

[2. Conductor Vulnerability](#Conductor-Vulnerability)

[3. Resilience Metric](#Resilience-Metric)

[4. Optimal Grid Operation under Extreme Events](#Optimal-Grid-Operation-under-Extreme-Events)



The pole failure model in GridLAB-D has been updated to support the extended Grid Resilience Intelligence Platform (GRIP) use case for the *HiPAS Project (CEC EPC-17-046)*. Utility structures are analysed while accouting for presence of conductors, equipment, hardware, miscelaneous cables and extreme weather. The pole failure model in GridLAB-D is designed to examine multiple failure modes. However, given that ground-level structural failures are reported as the most frequent, the current implementation only supports these. Other failure modes are under current implementation and will be available in future versions of HiPAS GridLAB-D.



Detailed implementation and methodology in the following sections. 

### Pole Vulnerability
#### 1.1 Bulk Pole Vulnerability 
#### 1.2 Pole Vulnerability with Network Model

### Conductor Vulnerability
### Resilience Metric
### Optimal Grid Operation under Extreme Events

### Ground-level Failure

A pole can fail at or near the ground line due to excessive forces on the structure. The following forces are considered:

1. Wire weight loading due to pole tilt angle
2. Wire loading due to wind pressure on wire
3. Loading due to wire tension asymmetry
4. Wire ice loading
5. Wire sag loading due to sag asymmetry
6. Wire loading due to line sway
7. Wire loading due to line gallop

*Other failure modes are possible, including superstructure failures and foundation failures, however these are not considered at this time.*
