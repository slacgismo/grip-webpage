### Status: Completed  

**Packetized Energy contracted with licensed and insured installers to complete the installation of the Mello smart thermostat on the members’ water heaters.**

### Description of the process/scenario:
#### *The information below explains the deployment process for the Absorption project in further detail.*



GRIP deployed 130 Mello devices, several EV charging stations and 1 battery system with VEC.  In order to reach the 150 devices required for this project,  additional devices were included from neighboring utilities including Green Mountain Power (GMP) and Burlington Electric Department (BED). GMP had 84 Mello devices deployed, and Burlington Electric had 75. For each of the water heaters using the Mello device for controls, Mello monitors the local water temperature and sends periodic requests to the Nimble cloud to consume a “packet” of energy. The Nimble server monitor’s grid(in virtual islanding) conditions is a signal from the island manager based on the availability of solar power and/or storage resources to meet demand. It replies to the devices with a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ based on those grid conditions. Through this process many DERs can be managed to actively balance supply and demand for bulk grid or local grid services. For EV charging stations, Webasto TurboDX Level 2 charging station was utilized. For batteries, an array of 6 of their 1.2 kWh AC battery systems at one of VEC’s facilities was installed.

               **Deployment Validation Steps for the Hinesburg Circuit Model**

**The data for this circuit is from a distribution system in Hinesburg, VT in Vermont Electric Coop’s territory.**

*Step 1*: Develop a GridLab-D model of the full Hinesburg circuit and validate the power flow model of this circuit by validating with our utility partner that the results aligned with their internal models.

 #### **Figure 1**: *Hinesburg circuit plotted with edge width relative to GridLab-D*

![Figure 2-Hinesburg circuit plotted with edge width relative to GridLab-D](/AB_FIGURE2_17.png)
#### **Figure 2**: *Hinesburg circuit plotted with node size relative to GridLab-D*

 *Figure 1* above represents the circuit with link width representing power flows. Main switches for absorption
/ virtual islanding algorithm are denoted by large squares (red are initially closed, green are
initially open). *Figure 2* represents the same network with node colors which indicate the node voltages.This circuit model modeled voltages and edge width and color relative to GridLab-D modeled line currents (larger red nodes are
switches and their size is not relative to the voltages at those locations).

 *Step 2*: Build a reduced format model that could be imported into GRIP. This reduced model (represented below as *figure 3* and *figure 4*) is developed by dividing the circuit into sections that were separated by switching elements, and then defining each group as a “super-node” in the reduced model. *Figure 4* represents the possible island groups as "super-nodes", where "super-nodes" are connected by switches, where the substation is located at “supernode_001". (Super-node sizes are scaled based on number of houses connected).

#### **Figure 4**: *Reduced model of Hinesburg circuit with possible islands grouped into “super-nodes"*


*Step 3*:  Develop a ‘large ice’ scenario for this full system-3 faulted nodes, and simulate this large ice scenario with the GRIP code. Without Absorption, this set of three faults would have left the entire circuit without power for 1 full day (the assumed time to repair).

*Note*: The following deployment steps were conducted and represents 100% of unserved energy. However, when Absorption is in place, *unserved energy was reduced to 10%* (see figure below).
