        The goal Recovery Phase of the Grid Resiliency and Intelligence Project (GRIP) is to leverage distributed energy resources (DER) to facilitate faster and safer electricity distribution network reconfiguration and recovery after a catastrophic network event. Grid recovery will be achieved through grid reconfiguration, islanding, and reconnecting islanded portions. Reconfiguration will necessitate switching actions (i.e. opening and closing of distribution network switches). To prevent large power surges, arcing, and equipment damage during switching actions, DER will be employed to minimize the voltage difference across the ends of a switch. This additionally reduces the need to deploy mobile utility crews. DER will be managed by a model-free online optimization algorithm, known as extremum seeking (ES). The GRIP platform has functionality to simulate the Recovery scenario, with GridLab-D as the underlying power flow solver.

        M. D. Sankur , R. Dobbe , A. von Meier , Member, IEEE, and D. B. Arnold, "Model-Free Optimal Voltage Phasor Regulation in Unbalanced Distribution Systems" IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SMART GRID, VOL. 11, NO. 1, JANUARY 2020

The proliferation of voltage Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) into electric power distribution grids presents new opportunities for utility operators to manage their systems more
effectively. In particular, distribution-level PMUs can serve as proxy measurements for active and reactive power flows, thus alleviating the need for current transformer-based measurements for certain applications. In this work, we explore the use of distri-
bution PMU measurements to optimally control line power flows without explicit measurements of these quantities and without
a priori knowledge of the underlying distribution system topology. To do so, we extend a 2 dimensional Extremum Seeking
(2D-ES) control paradigm to simultaneously manage Distributed Energy Resource (DER) active and reactive power contributions in unbalanced distribution systems. Simulation results show the
ability of the proposed approach to virtually island different portions of a 3-phase unbalanced the network using DER injections
while maintaining proper voltage magnitudes in the rest of the network.
