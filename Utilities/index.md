# Advanced Technology used by Utilities and Developers

GRIP uses telemetry data to identify infrastructure most at risk from severe weather. One of the key strengths of GRIP is its threat-agnostic grid modeling capabilities. Regardless of the type of extreme weather event, if telemetry data is available regarding the failed asset, GRIP's system modeling capabilities can provide actionable insights to the grid operator. 

## Approach

By taking an overall system perspective, GRIP is unique in its ability to coordinate heterogeneous datasets and derive numerous features to enable a proactive response to extreme weather.

 GRIP integrates disparate sources of data that don't usually get analyzed in the same context, while also providing an alternative source of data for the information that may not be available internally. For example, prior to an event, GRIP can use telemetry data to identify portions of the grid that are most likely to experience asset failure due to extreme wind or vegetation strike or identify wildland areas at risk of wildfire from close grid interface . Armed with this information, grid operators can deploy field resources in a timely manner to minimize equipment damage or loss of revenue due to power outages.

Prior to an extreme weather event, GRIP can generate scenarios to minimize customer impact. For example, if dry conditions and extreme winds are forecast for a particular section of the distribution system, GRIP can run a topology optimization algorithm and illustrate how to operate the system with two main objectives: minimizing the risk of wildfire and minimizing the magnitude and duration of power outages associated with that section of the grid. The algorithm prioritizes electrical resources based on wildfire risk, availability of DERs, and neighborhood census data to account for equity gaps. 

## Competitive Advantage

Several commercially available products on the market provide tailored solutions to either address system design or provide hosting platforms for utility data. Utilities also depend on in-house software tools to help manage operations. This diversity of tools results in uncoordinated intra department data sharing, gaps in analysis and overall operational inefficiency. As a result, GRIP provides more features for the same price as the competition.

## Next Steps

For GRIP to reach its scalable commercial potential, the platform requires additional utility deployments to generate the key performance metrics data from a real operational system. To address this challenge, we have secured additional funding to integrate the GRIP with a transactive utility operation system deployed at New Hampshire Electric Cooperative and plan to deploy it in the utilities under the Efficiency Maine Trustâ€™s jurisdiction. We will continue working with SCE and other utilities to develop additional use-cases. Furthermore, we will seek out additional partners to deploy and utilize GRIP in other geographical locations.
