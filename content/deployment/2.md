draft: false

Provide energy delivery support to critical customer loads at the
substation, due to loss of generation at the substation by fire, Power Safety Power Shut-
off (PSPS) or other (eg. loss of generation at Substation in Irvine last year) as an
alternative to PSPS, and improve operations practices.

               **Deployment Validation Steps for the Hinesburg Circuit Model**

**The data for this circuit is from a distribution system in Hinesburg, VT in Vermont Electric Coop’s territory.**

*Step 1*: Develop a GridLab-D model of the full Hinesburg circuit and validate the power flow model of this circuit by validating with our utility partner that the results aligned with their internal models.

**Figure 2**: *Hinesburg circuit plotted with node size relative to GridLab-D*

 *Figure 1* above represents the circuit with link width representing power flows. Main switches for absorption
/ virtual islanding algorithm are denoted by large squares (red are initially closed, green are
initially open). *Figure 2* represents the same network with node colors which indicate the node voltages.This circuit model modeled voltages and edge width and color relative to GridLab-D modeled line currents (larger red nodes are
switches and their size is not relative to the voltages at those locations).

 *Step 2*: Build a reduced format model that could be imported into GRIP. This reduced model (represented below as *figure 3* and *figure 4*) is developed by dividing the circuit into sections that were separated by switching elements, and then defining each group as a “super-node” in the reduced model. *Figure 4* represents the possible island groups as "super-nodes", where "super-nodes" are connected by switches, where the substation is located at “supernode_001". (Super-node sizes are scaled based on number of houses connected).

*Step 3*:  Develop a ‘large ice’ scenario for this full system-3 faulted nodes, and simulate this large ice scenario with the GRIP code. Without Absorption, this set of three faults would have left the entire circuit without power for 1 full day (the assumed time to repair).

*Note*: The following deployment steps were conducted and represents 100% of unserved energy. However, when Absorption is in place, *unserved energy was reduced to 10%* (see figure below).
