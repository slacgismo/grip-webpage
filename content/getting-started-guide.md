# This is where the web platform will live!

*Let us walk you through the step by step process to accessing the web platform! To begin, let us start with Anticipation*

**Step 1**: First thing is first, make sure you have a username and password to access your account.

**Step 2**: Access your dashboard from the menu, and select *simulation under the Anticipation option*. You can access various simulations depending on what you choose.

**Step 3**: Access GRIP simulation analysis for risk modeling and quantification questions that pertain to vegetation. This is where the user can access information such as vulnerability levels, navigate specific node locations. The simulation analysis allows for users to see effects of vegetation on on the electrical system and the effect of the electrical system on the surrounding environment
