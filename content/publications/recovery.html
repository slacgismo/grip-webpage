        The goal Recovery Phase of the Grid Resiliency and Intelligence Project (GRIP) is to leverage distributed energy resources (DER) to facilitate faster and safer electricity distribution network reconfiguration and recovery after a catastrophic network event. Grid recovery will be achieved through grid reconfiguration, islanding, and reconnecting islanded portions. Reconfiguration will necessitate switching actions (i.e. opening and closing of distribution network switches). To prevent large power surges, arcing, and equipment damage during switching actions, DER will be employed to minimize the voltage difference across the ends of a switch. This additionally reduces the need to deploy mobile utility crews. DER will be managed by a model-free online optimization algorithm, known as extremum seeking (ES). The GRIP platform has functionality to simulate the Recovery scenario, with GridLab-D as the underlying power flow solver.
