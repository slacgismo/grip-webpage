#### **Goal of the Recovery Phase and GRIP**: *leverage distributed energy resources (DER) to facilitate faster and safer electricity distribution network reconfiguration and recovery after a catastrophic network event.*


#### The Recovery use-case characteristics
1. Increase the speed and safety of grid Recovery
2. Used to reconfigure portions of the grid by opening/closing switches


#### Current strategies
1. use of utility crews to be deployed with mobile generation to facilitate switching
2. minimizing power surges
3. Arcing when opening/closing switches

 In order to prevent large power surges, acing, and equipment damage during switching actions, DER will be employed to minimize the voltage difference across the ends of a switch.

#### Cool Features of DER

-reduce the need for manned utility crews
-DER will be managed by a model-free online optimization algorithm-ES

#### Description of the process/scenario:
Extremum Seeking (ES) is a model-free optimization and control approach that can be utilized online or offline. ES approximates gradient descent (in single and multiple dimensions). Through disturbance of system input (output of the ES), the ES algorithm estimates the gradient of an unknown objective function with respect to its control setpoint(s). The Extremum Seeking approach has been tested in hardware in the loop experiments and in live field tests.
